Sat capsule - use only as a content node
-----------
Depending upon the feature Red Hat Satellite Capsule can be used in 2 ways:
1). Red Hat Satellite Capsule Server as a Content Node ------> provides only feature A
2). Red HatSatellite Capsule Server as a Content Node with Smart Proxy ------> provides feature A & B



RH Satellite is a system management solutions that lets you deploy, configure and manitain your systems across physical, virtual and cloud enviroment.
RH Satellite Server synchronizes the content from Red Hat Customer Portal and provides functionally such as life cycle management, ACL, subs management, as well as GUI, CLI and API access
RH Satellite Capsule provides content federation and run localized services to discover, provision, control and configure hosts. 


I am just trying to understand the purpose of Satellite Capsule Server. According to https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/satellite/faq, The Red Hat Satellite Capsule Server is used to extend the management of Red Hat Satellite to remote datacenters. Typically a Red Hat Satellite Capsule Server instance is deployed in each remote datacenter to federate services like provisioning so they can be performed locally.
